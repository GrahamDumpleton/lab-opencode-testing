Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll explore OpenCode running within an interactive learning environment powered by Educates. This workshop serves as a test environment to demonstrate how OpenCode, an AI-powered coding assistant, can be integrated into educational settings with LLM access provided through LiteLLM.

Throughout this workshop, you'll learn how to leverage OpenCode's capabilities while working in a controlled, educational environment that combines the power of AI-assisted development with structured learning modules.
