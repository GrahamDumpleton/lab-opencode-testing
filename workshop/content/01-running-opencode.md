title: Running OpenCode
---

While you could run OpenCode in a standalone terminal, for this workshop you'll use a terminal integrated within VS Code. This setup offers a more seamless development experience and matches common coding practices.

A VS Code task has been set up to make this easy. You can launch OpenCode by clicking the action below, or by opening the command palette in VS Code, selecting "Task: Run Task," and choosing "OpenCode".

OpenCode is designed to help with coding tasks, but it also serves as a general-purpose language model that can answer many types of questions. To verify that the LLM is working, ask it a question and check its response.

What model are you and what is the cutoff date for what you know?

If everything works as expected, you can proceed to test it with a simple coding task.
